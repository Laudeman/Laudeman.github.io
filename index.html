    Welcome to our first site. Today we will be exploring the gallery of Zachary, a young boy from lonely Wisconsin. It is our
    mission to ensure each and every little African boy receives a postcard each holiday of Zachary bowl cut. Thank you for
    your generous donations as each one is used to fuel our never-ending purchase orders of signed cooking bowls and scissors.

    An essential part in learning Zachary's style is first analyzing some of the photorealisitic photoshopped images of Zachary
    holding his mobile cellular device with complete shit hair, no bowlcut, and a baggy white t-shirt that says "Ladies,
    I fuck." Later, you will see before-and-after images of when the bowl is accurately placed to create a fitting hairstyle
    for that t-shirt. Equally comparable to Trevor Nicholas, a young man obsessed with his sister's foot massages and chair-humping
    hobbies, which we will not include details for PG sake (FUCKED A CHAIR), we never quite see them meet standards of a
    decent woman. This is why many Wisconsins, also known as Wisconsies, share a common practice of incest. Trevor's mother
    usually spends her time focused on making private phone calls with the door open, and as a result, it is easy to conclude
    where Hope learned her hobbies.
